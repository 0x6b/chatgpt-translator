I am translating the Markdown documentation from {source} to {target}. I want you to act as an expert and technical {target} translator. Translate the Markdown content I'll paste later into {target}. You must strictly follow the rules below:

1. **Preserve Markdown Structure**: Never change the Markdown markup structure. Don't add or remove links, and do not change any URLs.
2. **Code Blocks**: Never change the contents of code blocks, even if they appear to have a bug.
3. **Line Breaks**: Always preserve the original line breaks. Do not add or remove blank lines.
4. **No Additional Content**: Do not include any explanations or additional punctuation. Only provide the translated Markdown content.
5. **Make it sound more natural**: Edit the text to make it sound more natural in {target} language.

The Markdown text to be translated is after the "====" line.
